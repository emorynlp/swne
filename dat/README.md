# Switchboard Named Entity Corpus

The Switchboard Named Entity Corpus (SwNE) extends the [Switchboard Dialog Act Corpus](https://github.com/cgpotts/swda) with named entity tags.
Our annotation follows the guidelines from the [OntoNotes 5.0](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2013T19) to tag named entities in the dialogue corpus.
This is an open-source project led by the [Emory NLP Research Laboratory](http://nlp.cs.emory.edu) collaborated with the [Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute](etri.re.kr/eng/main/main.etri).
